<h2>MTH 316 - Nonparametric Statistics </h2>
</center>

<p>
<p>
<h3>Overview</h3>
This course covers a variety of statistical topics which are used to extract information from
data.  This includes an introduction to nonparametric statistical procedures. Specific topics include 
order statistics, rank order statistics and scores, tests of goodness-of-fit, linear rank tests
for location and scale problems, and applications. We'll also use R to carry out statistical analyses.
A famous statistician (R. A. Fisher) once said, "Statistics can be regarded as the study of populations, 
as the study of variations, and as the study of methods of the reduction of data."  We will come to understand
how this statement made in 1925 still applies today and why the word "population" takes on a new meaning from 
a statistical point of view.

The lectures are very important for understanding the material, completing the homework, and doing well 
on the exams.  Please take notes during class and ask questions if you need a topic clarified.
I strongly encourage you to make use of my office hours.  This is a great way to get extra help on lecture
material, homework questions, and exam preparation.
