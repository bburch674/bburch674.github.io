<h3>Overview</h3>
This course provides a rigorous mathematical treatment of the theory of statistics, probability models,
random variables and vectors, and families of distributions.  This includes understanding the basic concepts
of probability and distribution theory, and applying these concepts to solve problems, construct
proofs, and test conjectures. A famous statistician (R. A. Fisher) once said, "Statistics can be regarded 
as the study of populations, as the study of variations, and as the study of methods of the reduction of data." 
We will come to understand how this statement made in 1925 still applies today and how mathematical statistics 
serves as the foundation for making decisions based on data.
