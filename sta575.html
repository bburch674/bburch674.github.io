<h2>STA 575 - Applied Sampling</h2>
</center>

<p>
<p>
<h3>Overview</h3>
This course covers a variety of sampling designs which are used to extract information from
data.  This includes simple random sampling, stratified sampling, systematic sampling, cluster sampling,
multistage sampling, detectability, line and point transects, and capture-recapture sampling. 
A famous statistician (R. A. Fisher)
once said, "Statistics can be regarded as the study of populations, as the study of variations, and as
the study of methods of the reduction of data."  We will come to understand how this statement made in 1925
still applies today and how sampling can be used to make quality decisions.

The lectures are very important for understanding the material, completing the homework, and doing well 
on the exams.  Please take notes during class and ask questions if you need a topic clarified.
I strongly encourage you to make use of my office hours.  This is a great way to get extra help on lecture
material, homework questions, and exam preparation.
